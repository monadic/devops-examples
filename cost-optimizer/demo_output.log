🚀 DevOps as Apps - Cost Optimizer Demo
=====================================

📋 Step 1: Initialize Cost Optimizer with Enhanced SDK
   ✅ Created DevOps app using enhanced SDK
   ✅ Enabled Claude debug logging for AI analysis
   ✅ Connected to Kubernetes cluster
   ✅ Connected to ConfigHub API

🔧 Step 2: ConfigHub Space Setup with Unique Prefix
   ✅ Generated unique prefix: 'efficient-whale-1234567890'
   ✅ Created space: efficient-whale-1234567890-cost-optimizer
   ✅ Created 'critical-costs' Set for high-priority items
   ✅ Created filter: 'high-cost-resources' (>$100/month)

📊 Step 3: Gather Resource Usage (Event-Driven)
   Found 4 deployments across cluster:
   - frontend-web: CPU 30.0%, Memory 33.3%, $245.50/month
   - backend-api: CPU 40.0%, Memory 40.0%, $408.75/month
   - cache-redis: CPU 15.0%, Memory 15.0%, $89.25/month
   - monitoring-prometheus: CPU 80.0%, Memory 75.0%, $178.50/month

🤖 Step 4: Claude AI Cost Analysis
   Claude Analysis Summary:
   📈 Total Monthly Cost: $922.00
   💰 Potential Savings: $208.95 (22.8%)
   🎯 Recommendations: 3

💡 Step 5: Cost Optimization Recommendations
   1. deployment/frontend-web (high priority)
      💵 Save $73.65/month - Frontend is over-provisioned with only 30% CPU and 33% memory utilization. Can safely reduce resources without impacting performance.
      🔧 Action: Update deployment unit: reduce CPU to 1.5 vCPU and memory to 2GB
      ⚠️  Risk: low

   2. statefulset/cache-redis (high priority)
      💵 Save $53.55/month - Redis cache is significantly over-provisioned with only 15% utilization. Memory can be reduced to match actual usage patterns.
      🔧 Action: Update StatefulSet unit: reduce memory to 512MB
      ⚠️  Risk: low

   3. deployment/backend-api (medium priority)
      💵 Save $81.75/month - Backend API has moderate utilization (40%) but could benefit from slight resource reduction with monitoring.
      🔧 Action: Update deployment unit: reduce CPU to 4 vCPU, monitor for 1 week
      ⚠️  Risk: medium

🏪 Step 6: Store Analysis in ConfigHub
   ✅ Created cost-analysis unit with full data
   ✅ Stored 2 high-priority recommendations in 'critical-costs' Set
   ✅ Applied Labels for filtering and querying

🌐 Step 7: Web Dashboard Live
   ✅ Dashboard updated with latest analysis
   🔗 View at: http://localhost:8081
   📊 Cost breakdown by resource type
   🎯 Interactive recommendations view
   📈 Auto-refresh every 30 seconds

⚡ Step 8: Event-Driven Processing
   ✅ Using RunWithInformers() for Kubernetes events
   ✅ Automatic cost analysis on deployment changes
   ✅ ConfigHub push-upgrade for propagating optimizations

🎉 Demo Complete!

The cost optimizer successfully demonstrated:
  ✅ Enhanced SDK integration with logging
  ✅ ConfigHub space/set/filter management
  ✅ Claude AI-powered cost analysis
  ✅ Real-time web dashboard
  ✅ Event-driven architecture
  ✅ Global-app deployment pattern

📋 Real Usage:
  ./cost-optimizer                    # Run with real K8s cluster
  CLAUDE_DEBUG_LOG=true ./cost-optimizer  # Enable full AI logging
  AUTO_APPLY_OPTIMIZATIONS=true ./cost-optimizer  # Auto-apply safe changes
