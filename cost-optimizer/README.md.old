# Cost Optimizer

AI-powered Kubernetes cost optimization using ConfigHub and our enhanced DevOps SDK.

## Overview

The Cost Optimizer is a DevOps application that:
- **Analyzes** Kubernetes resource usage across your cluster
- **Uses Claude AI** to generate intelligent cost optimization recommendations
- **Stores analysis** in ConfigHub for tracking and collaboration
- **Provides a web dashboard** for visualization and monitoring
- **Follows the global-app pattern** for ConfigHub-driven deployment

## Architecture

### Built with Enhanced DevOps SDK
- **Event-driven processing** using `RunWithInformers()`
- **Comprehensive Claude logging** with timestamped request/response tracking
- **Real ConfigHub integration** with space/set/filter management
- **High-level convenience helpers** for common operations

### ConfigHub Integration
- **Unique space naming** using `cub space new-prefix`
- **Sets for grouping** critical cost items
- **Filters for querying** high-cost resources and recommendations
- **Push-upgrade pattern** for promoting optimizations across environments

### AI-Powered Analysis
- **Claude AI integration** for intelligent recommendations
- **Risk assessment** for each suggested change
- **ConfigHub action mapping** for implementation
- **Automatic application** of low-risk optimizations (optional)

## Quick Start

### Demo Mode
```bash
# See the cost optimizer in action with mock data
./cost-optimizer demo
```

### Real Deployment with ConfigHub

```bash
# Set environment variables
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/kubeconfig
export CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-key
export NAMESPACE=qa  # Namespace to analyze

# Build and run
go build
./cost-optimizer
```

## Deployment to Kubernetes

```bash
# Create namespace and secrets
kubectl create namespace devops-apps
kubectl create secret generic cost-optimizer-secrets \
  --from-literal=cub-token=$CUB_TOKEN \
  --from-literal=claude-api-key=$CLAUDE_API_KEY \
  -n devops-apps

# Deploy
kubectl apply -f k8s/deployment.yaml

# Check logs
kubectl logs -f deployment/cost-optimizer -n devops-apps
```

## Configuration

| Environment Variable | Description | Default |
|---------------------|-------------|---------|
| `NAMESPACE` | Namespace to analyze | `default` |
| `CUB_SPACE` | ConfigHub space for optimizations | `acorn-bear-qa` |
| `CLAUDE_API_KEY` | Claude API key for AI analysis | Required |
| `AUTO_OPTIMIZE` | Automatically apply optimizations | `false` |

## How This Differs from Workflows

### This Cost Optimizer (DevOps App)
- **Persistent**: Runs continuously as a Deployment
- **Stateful**: Tracks costs over time
- **Learning**: Can improve recommendations based on history
- **Integrated**: Direct Kubernetes API access
- **Versioned**: Can be rolled back like any app

### Workflow Approach (e.g., Agentic DevOps Tools)
- **Triggered**: Runs on schedule or event
- **Stateless**: No memory between runs
- **Simple**: Pre-built analysis
- **Limited**: Can't access metrics directly
- **Not versioned**: Workflow config, not an app

## Integration with ConfigHub

When optimizations are found, the app can:

1. Create a new ConfigHub space (e.g., `qa-cost-opt-123456`)
2. Apply recommended changes to units in that space
3. Test in isolation before promoting
4. Gradually roll out using ConfigHub's promotion model

Example:
```
acorn-bear-qa (current)
    └── acorn-bear-qa-cost-opt-123456 (optimization)
            ├── backend (reduced CPU/memory)
            ├── frontend (reduced replicas)
            └── postgres (optimized storage)
```

## Claude Integration

Claude analyzes the resource data and provides:
- Intelligent recommendations beyond simple heuristics
- Risk assessment for each optimization
- Explanation of why each change makes sense
- Consideration of workload patterns

The Claude prompt includes:
- Current resource allocations
- Actual usage metrics
- Cost calculations
- Optimization goals

## Future Enhancements

1. **Historical Analysis**: Track usage patterns over time
2. **Predictive Scaling**: Anticipate load changes
3. **Multi-Cloud**: Support AWS, GCP, Azure pricing
4. **Spot Instances**: Recommend spot/preemptible instances
5. **Network Costs**: Analyze data transfer costs
6. **Automated Rollout**: Gradual application of optimizations
7. **Prometheus Integration**: Richer metrics
8. **Slack Notifications**: Alert on savings opportunities

## Why This Architecture?

This demonstrates that cost optimization is not a one-time script or workflow, but a **continuous application** that:
- Monitors constantly
- Learns from patterns
- Integrates deeply with infrastructure
- Can be managed like any other application

Just like global-app serves business logic, cost-optimizer serves DevOps optimization logic.
