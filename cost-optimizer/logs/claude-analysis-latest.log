Duration: 5.600384083s

PROMPT SENT TO CLAUDE:
------------------------
Analyze the following Kubernetes resource usage data and provide cost optimization recommendations.

We're running on AWS EKS with real pricing:
- $0.024 per vCPU-hour ($17.28/month per core)
- $0.006 per GB-hour ($4.32/month per GB)
- Based on m5 instance family

Focus on:
1. Resources with low utilization (<50%) that can be right-sized
2. Over-provisioned deployments that can be scaled down
3. Resources that might be candidates for removal
4. Storage optimization opportunities

Data provided included:
- backend-api (drift-test): 5 replicas, 0% CPU utilization, 11% memory utilization
- frontend-web (drift-test): 1 replica, 0% CPU utilization, 22% memory utilization
- coredns (kube-system): 2 replicas, 6.5% CPU utilization, 24.5% memory utilization
- metrics-server (kube-system): 1 replica, 8% CPU utilization, 12% memory utilization
- local-path-provisioner: 6m CPU used (no requests set)
