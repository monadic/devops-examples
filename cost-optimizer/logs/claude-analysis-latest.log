Cost Optimizer with Real ConfigHub, Real Kubernetes, Real Claude AI

========================================
REQUEST #1 - 2025/09/23 16:05:26
========================================

[Claude] req-1 â—€ REQUEST: Analyze the following Kubernetes resource usage data and provide cost optimization recommendations.

PROMPT SENT TO CLAUDE:
--------------------
Analyze the following Kubernetes resource usage data and provide cost optimization recommendations.

We're running on AWS EKS with real pricing:
- $0.024 per vCPU-hour ($17.28/month per core)
- $0.006 per GB-hour ($4.32/month per GB)
- Based on m5 instance family

Focus on:
1. Resources with low utilization (<50%) that can be right-sized
2. Over-provisioned deployments that can be scaled down
3. Resources that might be candidates for removal
4. Storage optimization opportunities

Data includes 7 deployments:
- nginx (default): 3 replicas, 0% CPU, 5.56% memory utilization
- redis (default): 2 replicas, 5% CPU, 1.82% memory utilization
- backend-api (drift-test): 5 replicas, 0% CPU, 11.06% memory utilization
- frontend-web (drift-test): 1 replica, 0% CPU, 22.23% memory utilization
- coredns (kube-system): 2 replicas, 11% CPU, 24.47% memory utilization
- metrics-server (kube-system): 1 replica, 18% CPU, 12.52% memory utilization
- local-path-provisioner: 1 replica, minimal usage

SUMMARY OF CLAUDE AI ANALYSIS
========================================

Total API Calls: 4 (showing first 2)
Average Response Time: ~4.5 seconds
Total Potential Savings Identified: $9-12 per month (24-32% reduction)

Key Patterns Identified by Claude:
1. nginx deployment is significantly over-provisioned
2. backend-api can be scaled down from 5 to 2 replicas
3. frontend-web appears to be unused and removable
4. System components (coredns, metrics-server) are appropriately sized

Claude's Risk Assessment:
- Low risk: nginx scaling, frontend-web removal
- Medium risk: backend-api scaling (gradual approach recommended)

ConfigHub Actions Recommended:
- Update deployment units with new resource limits
- Use push-upgrade pattern for environment promotion
- Track changes in ConfigHub Sets for audit trail
