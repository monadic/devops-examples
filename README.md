# DevOps Examples 

## ðŸš€ Overview

Examples of ConfigHub apps as defined here: [monadic/devops-as-apps-project](https://github.com/monadic/devops-as-apps-project)

1. Drift Detector

  - Event-driven Kubernetes configuration drift detection
  - Uses ConfigHub Sets, Filters, and bulk operations
  - Auto-corrects drift by updating existing units (not creating new "-fix" units)
  - Real-time dashboard on :8080
  - Claude AI integration for drift analysis
  - Full ConfigHub deployment pattern with push-upgrade

  2. Cost Optimizer

  - AI-powered cost optimization with Claude
  - NEW: OpenCost integration for real cloud cost data (vs estimates)
  - Web dashboard on :8081 with Claude API history viewer
  - Metrics-server integration for real resource usage
  - Uses Sets for grouping recommendations
  - Push-upgrade for promoting optimizations across environments

  3. Cost Impact Monitor

  - Pre-deployment cost analysis before units are applied
  - Monitors all ConfigHub spaces for cost impact
  - Trigger-based hooks (pre/post deployment)
  - Web dashboard on :8083
  - Self-deploys through ConfigHub
  - Complements Cost Optimizer (monitor = pre-deployment, optimizer = post-deployment)



## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.21+
- ConfigHub account ([sign up](https://confighub.com))
- Kubernetes cluster (or [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/) for testing)
- Claude API key ([get one](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)) - **Required by default**
- **ConfigHub Worker** - Required for ConfigHub â†” Kubernetes bridge (see [WORKER-SETUP.md](WORKER-SETUP.md))

### Installation

1. **Clone and authenticate:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monadic/devops-examples.git
   cd devops-examples
   cub auth login
   ```

2. **Setup ConfigHub Worker (REQUIRED):**
   ```bash
   ./setup-worker.sh      # Creates worker and targets
   cub worker run devops-worker  # Run in separate terminal
   ```

3. **Try the drift detector:**
   ```bash
   cd drift-detector
   ./bin/install-base     # Set up ConfigHub resources (global-app pattern)
   ./bin/install-envs     # Create environment hierarchy
   ./drift-detector demo  # Run interactive demo
   ```

3. **Test with real cluster:**
   ```bash
   ./bin/create-cluster     # Create Kind cluster
   ./bin/deploy-test        # Deploy test workloads
   ./drift-detector         # Run drift detection
   ```

## ðŸ§ª Testing Protocol

All apps follow a standardized 2-step testing protocol:

### Step 1: Local Tests (Fast)
```bash
cd app-name
go test -v           # Unit tests with mocks
./app-name demo      # Demo mode
```

### Step 2: Integration Tests (Real Services)
```bash
export CUB_TOKEN="$(cub auth get-token)"
./bin/create-cluster                    # Create Kind cluster
go test -tags=integration -v            # Test with real APIs
./app-name                              # Run against cluster
```
